tdrpg-tools
===========

A set of tools for the tdrpg-haxe project (ie, [Defender's Quest 2](http://www.defendersquest.com/2/))

#TileProcess

TileProcess lets an artist create a "sparse" tileset, then does all the boring scut-work of generating tile connection permutations for final use in the game.

It also creates a "Quick Brown Fox" tiling test that uses every tile connection so the artist can see how they're doing.

#PathFindingTest (moved!)
PathFindingTest has now become an official [HaxeFlixel](http://github.com/HaxeFlixel) demo, [Heatmap Pathfinding](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos/tree/dev/Flixel%20Features/HeatmapPathfinding)

(The version in this repo is now obsolete)

#Animator (moved!)
Animator has been officially accepted into the [HaxeFlixel](http://github.com/HaxeFlixel) project @ [flixel-editors](http://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-editors)! 

I'm permanently moving Animator over there to avoid accidentally committing to the wrong place. 

I'll still keep this repo around for tools that HaxeFlixel isn't interested in.
