tdrpg-tools
===========

A set of tools for the tdrpg-haxe project

#PathFindingTest
A simple test of the [many-to-one pathfinding method](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/TylerGlaiel/20121007/178966/Some_experiments_in_pathfinding__AI.php)

#Animator (moved!)
Animator has been officially accepted into the [HaxeFlixel](http://github.com/HaxeFlixel) project @ [flixel-editors](http://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-editors)! 

I'm permanently moving Animator over there to avoid accidentally committing to the wrong place. 

I'll still keep this repo around for tools that HaxeFlixel isn't interested in.
